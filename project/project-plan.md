# Project Plan

## Title

Solar Radiation Prediction Analysis

## Main Question

1. Will it be reasonable to invest on Solar Energy panels based on future Radiation Levels?
2. Can we accurately predict solar radiation levels based on environmental conditions such as wind direction, wind speed, humidity, and temperature?
## Description

This project aims to analyze the relationship between various  conditions and solar radiation to predict the efficiency of using solar panels in the near future. Using data collected over the past four months, this study will employ statistical adata to forecast solar radiation levels.
