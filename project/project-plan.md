## Title

Correlation Between COVID-19 Deaths and Average Temperature in Alabama, 2020

## Main Question

1. How did the average temperature in Alabama during the year 2020 correlate with the number of COVID-19 death cases in the state?

## Description
This project aims to analyze the relationship between average temperature and COVID-19 death cases in Alabama throughout the year 2020. By examining temperature data alongside COVID-19 mortality rates, we seek to understand if and how variations in temperature increased or decreased the death cases in the state. The study will use statistical methods to explore potential correlations and draw insights from the data collected.
